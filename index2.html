The name Serengeti means endless plains, and that is exactly what you’ll find within the park. More than a million wildebeest, and over 200,000 zebras, migrate through the plains each year. When you visit the Serengeti National Park, you will be able to see wildlife like cheetahs, leopards, giraffes, buffalo, gazelles and so much more. Hot air balloon trips as well as photo safaris are both incredible ways to make the most of the Serengeti.</p>

In Zimbabwe, the falls as well as the surrounding town is known as Victoria Falls. Across the border in Zambia, the falls are called Mosi-oa-Tunya. From December to March, the falls are more dramatic because it is also the rainy season, but the rest of the year can offer a less obscured view.
